# Flash Cards

This project is a simple flash card game that runs in the terminal. It is my initial project for learning Java. It is translated and refactored from a Ruby project I did in Turing School of Software and Design.

Navigate to src/main/FlashCardsRunner.java and run the main method to play the game.
